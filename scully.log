This might happen when there are lazy-loaded routes, that are not loaded,
Or when there are paths we can not resolve statically.
Check the routes in your app, rebuild and retry.
(You can inspect the error by passing the --showGuessError flag

When there are extraRoutes in your config, we will still try to render those.
